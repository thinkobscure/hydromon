HydroMon
========

Hydroponic / Aquaponic monitoring system. Project currently mostly incomplete, but here to store early stage docs for later on, when I can pick it back up. Will add more peices as I find them/time.

Why build it?
------------

- Rise of urban farming has lead to increase of hydroponic setups for growing food.
  - vertical hydroponics (WindowFarms), aquaponic setups

- Systems must maintain certain parameters or risk losing product

- Current systems expensive, clunky, old feeling

What is it?
------------------

- Monitor pH, ec, DO, CO2, Temp, RH%

- Control Lights, Pumps, etc.

- Smart Device (IP Connected)

- Send alerts for system maintenance

- Provide the “Dropcam Experience” for setup & control (limit the cognitive overhead)
