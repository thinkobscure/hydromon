HydroMon
========

Hydroponic / Aquaponic monitoring system. Project currently mostly incomplete, but here to store early stage docs for later on, when I can pick it back up. Will add more peices as I find them/time. 


Background
--------------

In 2011 I started growing strawberries hydroponically in vertical towers and learned an amazing amount, especially about how important certain nutrient parameters are to the system. During this time I thought there had to be a better monitoring system, and I found there are automated monitoring systems but most are either very expensive (industrial users) and/or have clunky old interfaces. So given this is the age of internet connected smart devices and modern web interfaces I knew there were much better ways of presenting critical information to the operator. So I started working on a project I thought could help with small scale hydroponics and aquaponics monitoring, and be expanded to cover large scale industrial users. I have currently acquired most of the hardware needed and built the water-resistant enclosure, designed and soldered the hardware and have the vision of the software in my head but need time to develop it. At the end of 2012 when I expected to devote more time to this we were thrown a curveball with a house fire in the unit above us which displaced us for 5 months and depleted any savings I had remaining. That's when this project was boxed up. I hope to unbox this project in the future.


Why build it?
----------------

- Rise of urban farming has lead to increase of hydroponic setups for growing food.
  - vertical hydroponics (WindowFarms), aquaponic setups

- Systems must maintain certain parameters or risk losing product

- Current systems expensive, clunky, old feeling

What is it?
------------------

- Monitor pH, ec, DO, CO2, Temp, RH%

- Control Lights, Pumps, etc.

- Smart Device (IP Connected)

- Send alerts for system maintenance

- Provide the “Dropcam Experience” for setup & control (limit the cognitive overhead)
